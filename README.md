GitHub is a great tool to store projects and to collaborate with others, but its usefulness does not stop there. We’ll use a service called GitHub Pages to share our web page creations on the World Wide Web.

There are many different ways to deploy a website to the public Internet. We’ll be using GitHub’s free service called GitHub Pages.
